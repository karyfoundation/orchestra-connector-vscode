# Orchestra Connector for Visual Studio Code

If you use a comment in your files like this:
```
// /path/to/the/quartet/file/of/myRegEx/file.quartet
let myRegEx = /something/g;
```
If you place the caret on either comment line or the regex line and press `alt+q`, Connector will open the Quartet in an Orchestra window and then when you save the file it will update your code.
